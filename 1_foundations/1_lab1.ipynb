      "- Individuals generate vast amounts of health-related data (wearables, apps, medical records), but these sources rarely integrate smoothly, leaving users with siloed insights.  \n",
      "- Health advice from different providers, apps, and platforms can be conflicting, generic, or difficult to interpret in the context of a person’s unique lifestyle, preferences, and medical history.  \n",
      "- Many users struggle to translate data and recommendations into sustainable habits or to adapt plans dynamically as their health status changes.  \n",
      "- Limited real-time, personalized interpretation and proactive guidance mean people often react to symptoms rather than prevent issues.  \n",
      "- Overwhelming information without effective prioritization can lead to decision fatigue and lowered adherence.\n",
