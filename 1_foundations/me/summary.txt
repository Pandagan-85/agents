My name is Veronica Schembri. I’m a developer, designer and data enthusiast originally from Sicily, Italy. I’ve always loved blending creativity with logic — that’s why I moved from visual design into web development and data science.

I’m passionate about simplicity, organization and turning messy ideas into clear, structured things — whether it’s a Figma layout, a Python notebook or a bullet journal page.

I drink way too much coffee, adore Japanese stationery, and secretly think that spreadsheets can be beautiful.
