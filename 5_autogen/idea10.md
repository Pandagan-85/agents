2. **AI Financial Coach - "FinBot":**

3. **Goal-Driven Savings Engine:**
   - Users can set specific financial objectives (e.g., home purchase, vacation, retirement) and receive customized savings blueprints. The platform tracks progress, sends reminders, and adjusts plans dynamically based on user behavior and market conditions.

4. **Tailored Investment Insights:**
