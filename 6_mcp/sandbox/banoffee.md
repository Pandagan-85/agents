## Description
This shockingly easy banoffee pie combines a crunchy graham cracker crust, soft and sweet dulce de leche, thick slices of fresh banana, and a mountain of billowy whipped cream. Everyone who tries a slice is instantly hooked.

## Ingredients
- 1 and 1/2 cups (180g) graham cracker crumbs (about 12 full sheet graham crackers)
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted
- 1 and 1/4 cups dulce de leche

### Whipped Cream
- 2 cups (480ml) cold heavy cream or heavy whipping cream

- 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
- Optional toppings: chocolate shavings, chopped nuts, or toffee bits for garnish

## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).
2. Make the crust: Grind graham crackers into fine crumbs. Stir the crumbs and sugar together, then stir in melted butter. Press mixture into ungreased 9-inch pie dish to form crust.
3. Bake crust for 15 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes.
4. For the whipped cream: Whip heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form.
5. Spread dulce de leche on top of crust.
6. Arrange banana slices in 1–2 layers on top of dulce de leche.
7. Spread whipped cream on top.
8. Refrigerate pie uncovered for at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.
9. Garnish with toppings before serving, if desired.
10. Cover and store leftover pie in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

## Notes
- Make ahead: Graham cracker crust can be refrigerated or frozen before assembly. Dulce de leche can be made up to 2 weeks in advance. Fully assembled pie can be prepared up to 1 day in advance.
- Dulce de leche can be made by baking a can of sweetened condensed milk in a water bath at 350°F (177°C) for about 2 hours.
- To keep banana slices fresh, you can squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over them before layering.
- If graham crackers are not available, digestive biscuits can be used as a substitute.
